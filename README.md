Genomon-ITDetector
==================

Genomon-ITDetector is a software package for internal tandem duplication detection from cancer genome sequencing data.

Dependecy
----------

* [blat](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)
* [bedtools](https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/)
* [CAP3](http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/)
* [fasta36](http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta/fasta36/)

SetUp
----------

1. Download the Genomon-ITDetector package to any directory.

2. Download and install following external tools to any directory.  
  **blat**  (Ver. 34x13).  
  **bedtools** (Ver. 2.14.3).  
  **CAP3**  (Ver.Date: 12/21/07).  
  **fasta36** (Ver. 3.5c).  
  **SAMtools** (Ver. 0.1.18).  

3. Download refGene.txt, knownGene.txt, ensGene.txt and simpleRepeat.txt from **the UCSC site** and place them under the Genomon-ITDetector-master/db directory, and unpack them.  

4. create a 2bit hg19 human genome reference and a 11.ooc file for blat.  
  *change dir to the blat dir and create 2bit reference genome:   

       $ ./faToTwoBit in.fa out.2bit

  *create 11.ooc file:   
         
       $ ./blat -makeOoc=11.ooc -repMatch=2253 -tileSize=11 out.2bit test.fa test.psl  

5. Open config.env and set each entry.  
<table>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_HG19REF</th>
<td>the path to the reference genome (.fasta) to which your sequence data is aligned.(we just test on the hg19 human genome reference from the UCSC site.)</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_BLAT_REF</th>
<td>the path to the 2bit hg19 human genome reference (.2bit) you created in the SetUp section 4.</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_BLAT_OOC</th>
<td>the path to the 11.ooc file you created in the SetUp section 4.</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_BLAT</th>
<td>the path to the blat executable</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_BED_TOOLS</th>
<td>the path to the BEDtools executable</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_CAP3</th>
<td>the path to the CAP3 executable</td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PATH_TO_FASTA</th>
<td>the path to the fasta36 executable</td>

Usage
---

The command for creating the annotation database

    $ bash createAnnoDB.sh

The command for detecting ITDs

    $ bash detectITD.sh <path to the target bam file> <path to the output directory> <sample name>

You will get the "itd_list.tsv" in the specified output directory.


Test run
---

Use the following command

    $ bash detectITD.sh testdata/testin.bam testout testsample

The result ("itd_list.tsv") will be stored in the testout directory.


Create inhouse database
---

For filtering out polymorphisms and artifacts that are commonly occured among multiple samples

Please open inhouse/normal_inhouse_itd.list †,   
and add the paths of "inhouse_itd.tsv" † files for each of control samples. For example,   

    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample01/inhouse_itd.tsv
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample02/inhouse_itd.tsv
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample03/inhouse_itd.tsv
    …
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample50/inhouse_itd.tsv

† Please do not change the file name.   
† The file "inhouse_itd.tsv" is the file which contains the outputs obtained from detectITD.sh   

Please open inhouse/normal_inhouse_breakpoint.list †,   
and add the paths of "inhouse_breakpoint.tsv" † files for each of control samples. For example,   

    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample01/inhouse_breakpoint.tsv
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample02/inhouse_breakpoint.tsv
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample03/inhouse_breakpoint.tsv
    …
    $ /home/your_username/output/control_sample50/inhouse_breakpoint.tsv

† Please do not change the file name.   
† The "inhouse_breakpoint.tsv" is the file which contains the outputs obtained from detectITD.sh
