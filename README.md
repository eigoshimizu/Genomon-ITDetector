Genomon-ITDetector
==================

Genomon-ITDetector is a software package for detecting internal tandem duplication (ITD) from genome sequence data.

Dependecy
----------

* [blat](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)
* [bedtools](https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/)
* [CAP3](http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/)
* [fasta36](http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta/fasta36/)
* [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)
* [refGene.txt, knownGene.txt, ensGene.txt and simpleRepeat.txt from the UCSC site](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/)

SetUp
----------

1. Download the Genomon-ITDetector package to any directory.

2. Download and extract and install following external tools to any directory.  
  **blat**  (Ver. 34x13).  
  **bedtools** (Ver. 2.14.3).  
  **CAP3**  (Ver.Date: 12/21/07).  
  **fasta36** (Ver. 3.5c).  
  **SAMtools** (Ver. 0.1.18).  

3. Download the refGene.txt, knownGene.txt, ensGene.txt and simpleRepeat.txt files from **the UCSC site** and place them under the Genomon-ITDetector-master/db directory, and then unpack them.  

4. create a 11.ooc file and a 2bit hg19 human genome reference for blat.  
  change dir to the blat dir and create 2bit reference genome.  
  **$ ./faToTwoBit in.fa out.2bit**  
  create 11.ooc file.  
  **$ ./blat -makeOoc=11.ooc -repMatch=2253 -tileSize=11 out.2bit test.fa test.psl**  

5. Open config.env and set each entry.  
  **PATH_TO_HG19REF**: the path to the reference genome (.fasta) to which your sequence data is aligned.(we just test on the hg19 human genome reference from the UCSC site.)  
  **PATH_TO_BLAT_REF**: the path to the 2bit hg19 human genome reference (.2bit) you created in the SetUp 4 section.  
  **PATH_TO_BLAT_OOC**: the path to the 11.ooc file you created in the SetUp 4 section.  
  **PATH_TO_BLAT**: the path to the blat executable  
  **PATH_TO_BED_TOOLS**: the path to the BEDtools executable  
  **PATH_TO_CAP3**: the path to the CAP3 executable  
  **PATH_TO_FASTA**: the path to the fasta36 executable  
  **PATH_TO_SAMTOOLS**: the path to the SAMtools executable  


How to run
---

Create the annotation database

    $ bash createAnnoDB.sh

Just type the following command

    $ bash detectITD.sh <path to the target bam file> <path to the output directory>

Then you will get the 'itd_list.tsv' under the specified output directory.


Test run
---

Just type the following command

    $ bash detectITD.sh testdata/testin.bam testout testsample

Result is stored under the testout directory.

Output
---

results are formatted as TSV format.

The columns are exaplined below:   

</table>
  **ITD_breakpoint_pair(ITD-BPP)**:   
  **supported_reads(strand+)supported_reads(strand-)**: ratio of supported reads aligned to positive(negative) strand.   
  **average_depth**: average sequencing depths    
  **chr(contig) start_position(contig) end_position(contig)**: position of assembled contig sequence.   
  **assembled_contig_sequence**: result of assembling support reads and their mape pairs.   
  **length**: length of assembled contig sequence.   
  **chr(OIN) start_position(OIN) end_position(OIN)**: position of OIN.  
  **observed_inserted_nucleotide(OIN)**: unmapped part on contig sequencing.  
  **length(OIN) length(PDN)**: length of OIN and PDN.   
  **selected_ITD-BPP"**: reliability ITD-BPP (1 or 2). If the ITD-BPP is the same, '1,2' is output.   
  **matched_bases / length(PDN)**: the number of matched bases between the OIN and the PDN / length of PDN.   
  **length(OIN) / length(PDN)**: length of OIN / length of PDN.   
  **matched_bases / length(OIN)**: the number of matched bases between the OIN and the PDN / length of OIN.  
  **exon intron 5putr 3putr noncoding_exon noncoding_intron**: RefSeq Gene Name and Gene ID.   
  **ens_gene**: Ensamble Gene ID.  
  **known_gene**: Known Gene ID.  
  **tandem_repeat**:   
  **inhouse inhouse_left_breakpoint inhouse_right_breakpoint**: control sample name and supported read.       
  **grade**: grade (one of A, B, C)
